  Bicycle Colorado Club Memberships support our efforts to make riding safer and more accessible across the state.
  In addition, Club Members have access to our new Club Toolkit, which allows club administrators to build
  club calendars, manage their roster, see the clubâ€™s results, communicate with club members via email and text,
  and be involved with season-long Cup points competitions. Annual Club Membership is $100.
