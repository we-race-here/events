          Bicycle Colorado (BC) is a Denver-based nonprofit organization that has been advocating for safer and more
          equitable bicycling in Colorado for more than 30 years. On January 1, 2023, BC acquired the nonprofit
          organization Colorado Cycling, formerly known as the Bicycle Racing Association of Colorado (BRAC). BRAC was
          established in 1975, played a critical role in supporting amateur road, cyclocross and track racing and since
          2013 had served as the Local Association in Colorado for USA Cycling (USAC). In 2023, a Racing Membership with
          BC is included with the purchase of Race Membership in USAC.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Bicycle Colorado has expanded our Event Support Program to assume the role played by BRAC. This program
          supports the key stakeholders in both competitive and non-competitive cycling events, including participants,
          event directors/promoters, clubs, teams, officials, event registrars, partners and volunteers. This support
          includes managing a comprehensive events calendar, event promotion, serving as the Local Association for USAC,
          providing advocacy support to make the sport safer, and helping events manage relationships with
          municipalities and permitting agencies. With this expanded Event Support Program, BC grows its reach and
          connections within the Colorado bicycling community to grow the movement of people who want to improve the
          safety, convenience and fun of bicycling in Colorado for everyone.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          We are currently constructing this new digital platform to replace the old BRAC website and provide new
          management tools for clubs and event directors. Please create a user member account to view your race results,
          join a club or team, participate in season-long Cup points competitions, receive discount offers from our
          partners and opt-in to communications. Clubs and organizations can also create accounts to manage their
          members, events and race results.
